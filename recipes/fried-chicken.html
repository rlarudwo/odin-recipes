    <h2>Description</h2>
      <p>This is the only fried chicken recipe you will ever need because it combines all the tried-and-true tricks to ensure the juicest, most flavorful, crispiest chicken.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>1 (4 pound) chicken cut into pieces</li>
        <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        <li>2 cups all-purpose flour for coating</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon paprika</li>
        <li>salt and pepper to taste</li>
        <li>2 quarts vegetable oil for frying</li>
      </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>Take up your cut up chicken pieces and skin them if you prefer. Put the flour in a large plastic bag (let the amount of chicken you are coocking dictate the amount of flour you use). Season the flour with paprika, salt, and pepper to taste (paprika helps to brown the chicken).</li>
        <li>Dip chicken pieces in buttermilk. Then, a few at a time, put them in the bag with the flour, seal the bag and shake to coat well. Place the coated chicken on a cookie sheet or tray, and cover with a clean dish towel and waxed paper. <strong>Let sit until the flour is a paste-like consistency. This is crucial!</strong></li>
        <li>Fill a large skillet (cast iron is best) about 1/3 to 1/2 full with vegetable oil. Heat until <em>very</em> hot. Put in as many chicken pieces as the skillet can hold. Brown the chicken in <em>hot</em> oil on both sides. When browned, reduce heat and cover skillet; let cook for 30 minutes (the chicken will be cooked through but not crispy). Remove cover, raise heat again and continue to fry until crispy.</li>
        <li>Drain the fried chicken on paper towels. Depending on how much chicken you have, you may have to fry in a few shifts. Keep the finished chicken in a slightly warm oven while preparing the rest.</li>
      </ol>
